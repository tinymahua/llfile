# Target Positioning

Faster, more stable, and more user-friendly.

The future file manager is targeted at both professional and non-professional users in various fields. While keeping the operation habits of traditional file managers, it will add unique and more practical features.

The final name and logo of the future file manager are yet to be decided. Friends with creative ideas are welcome to share them.

It features a classic desktop software layout. The borderless interface is more concise.
Users can freely switch between light and dark themes, enhancing the visual experience.
The interface supports multiple languages, including Chinese and English, adapting smoothly to your preferred language.

# Function List

* Basic functions: Being improved
    * Quick navigation
    * Usage statistics and analysis
    * Path address tool
    * Multi-tab pages
    * Directory content list
    * File management
    * Directory management
    * Task center
* Advanced functions: In the planning stage
* Extended functions: In the planning stage

Among the functions above, the commonly used ones in each basic function category have been implemented. For example:

> Quick navigation: The disk list navigation enables access to the disk root directory.
> Path address: Input, refresh, and back functions for the path address.
> Multi-tab pages: Open a new tab to view the directory content list.
> File management: Copy, cut, and delete operations.
> Task center: Visualize and control the progress of time-consuming operations like copying.

The basic functions are being improved by referring to traditional file managers. The advanced and extended functions are still in the planning process.

# Thoughts on File Manager Functions

A file manager generally has two main functions: directory management and file management.

Directory management means managing all directory items in the file system, including common operations like creating, modifying, deleting, moving, and counting.
File management mainly offers routine operations related to file attributes. Operations on specific files, such as format conversion, editing, and organization, are handled by external programs.
This decoupling model is crucial in software engineering. However, it leads to the problem of scattered programs, making it hard for them to collaborate efficiently or automate tasks.

This issue is mainly due to the closed nature of the software field. Once installed, software functions rarely change unless there's an upgrade, making it difficult to build a complete ecosystem.
Therefore, the key feature of the future file manager will be its expandability. Functions should be pluggable and extensible. While ensuring the reliability of basic functions, we aim to explore more possibilities for additional features.
